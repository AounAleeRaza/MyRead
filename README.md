 MyRead App

Project Purpose:

MyReads is a bookshelf app that allows us to select and categorize books that we have read, currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React Fundamentals to build the application.


 How to Use the App
 Books are sorted into three categories:
"Currently Reading", "Want to Read" and "Read".
 Every book features green button to change the shelf of the book. Setting option to none hides the book from the shelf.
